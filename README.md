# My Dotfiles
This repository contains all of my configuration (dotfiles) so I can easily sync configuration between devices (and so you can "steal" my dotfiles ðŸ˜ˆ (even tho idk why you would want my dotfiles, they are kinda not good compared to other ones))

# If you "steal" my dotfiles...
You can use the init.sh script to automatically setup everything.

## Steps to "steal" my dotfiles
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/xblazedev/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
2. Execute the 'init.sh' file in '~/.dotfiles' (make sure to have homebrew and oh-my-zsh already installed (even tho their config will get overwritten)):
```
./init.sh
```
3. Follow the instructions and done!
